# 904. Fruit Into Baskets

## Approach 1: Sliding Window

Track tree types if you see different tree types than the saved two type. Reset the last seen with the new one, else continue to increase current tree count .Do not forget to update the max count at every iteration.

```
A B B A A B C C B A
X X X X X X
          X X X X
                X X
```

- Create a variable to save max tree count

- Create variables to save two tree types

- Create a variable to save current tree count
- Create a variable to save main tree count

- Iterate over the array

  - If the current tree type is last seen two type increase current tree count
  - Else update current tree type to last seen-main tree type + 1( for this tree type)

  - Update max tree type by comparing it with current tree count

  - If the current tree type is main tree type increase it by 1
  - Move main tree type to other tree type and reset the main tree type with the current tree type. Set main tree type to 1 as well.

- Return max tree count

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int totalFruit(vector<int>& trees) {
        int maxTreeCount = 0;

        int treeTypeOne = -1;
        int treeTypeTwo = -1;

        int countOfTreeTypeOne = 0;
        int countOfTreeTypeTwo = 0;

        int currentTreeCount = 0;
        for(auto tree: trees) {
            if(tree == treeTypeOne or tree == treeTypeTwo) {
                currentTreeCount++;
            } else {
                currentTreeCount = countOfTreeTypeTwo + 1;
            }

            maxTreeCount = max(maxTreeCount, currentTreeCount);

            if(tree == treeTypeTwo) {
                countOfTreeTypeTwo++;
            } else {
                // new tree seen
                treeTypeOne = treeTypeTwo;
                treeTypeTwo = tree;
                countOfTreeTypeTwo = 1;
            }
        }

        return maxTreeCount;
    }
};
```
